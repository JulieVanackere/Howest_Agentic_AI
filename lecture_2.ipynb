    "2. **Tool Integration**: Give the agent access to the right tools\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**: Guide the agent on how to handle problems\n",

    "\n",
    "Your primary job is to help users schedule events efficiently and accurately.\n",

    "WHEN SCHEDULING EVENTS:\n",
    "1. Extract key details: title, date, start time, end time, location, description\n",
    "2. If ANY required information is missing (title, date, start_time, end_time), ask the user for clarification\n",
    "3. Use ONLY the create_calendar_event function to schedule events\n",
    "4. Always confirm successful scheduling with event details\n",
    "\n",
    "FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:\n",
    "- Dates: Use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2025-10-29)\n",
    "- Times: Use 24-hour format HH:MM (e.g., 14:30 for 2:30 PM)\n",
    "- If user gives 12-hour format, convert to 24-hour\n",
    "\n",
    "HELPFUL FEATURES:\n",
    "- Use get_current_date() to handle relative dates like \"tomorrow\", \"next Monday\"\n",
    "- Use list_upcoming_events() to check for scheduling conflicts\n",
    "- Use calculate_duration() to help with time planning\n",
    "\n",
    "COMMUNICATION STYLE:\n",

    "\n",
    "Welcome to the most advanced section of our lecture! Here we'll explore how AI agents can collaborate with each other to solve complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What is Agent-to-Agent Collaboration?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent-to-Agent Collaboration** is when one AI agent uses another agent as a tool. This powerful pattern allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specialize Agents**: Each agent becomes an expert in specific domains\n",
    "- **Combine Capabilities**: Leverage multiple agents' strengths simultaneously  \n",
    "- **Modular Design**: Build complex systems from simpler, reusable components\n",
    "- **Scalable Architecture**: Add new capabilities without rebuilding everything\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Master Agent**: The primary agent that coordinates and makes decisions\n",
    "2. **Sub-Agent Tools**: Specialized agents converted into tools using `.as_tool()`\n",
    "3. **Delegation**: The master agent decides when to use sub-agents\n",
    "4. **Integration**: Results from sub-agents are integrated into the final response\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 Benefits of This Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🧠 Cognitive Load Distribution**: Each agent focuses on what it does best\n",
    "- **🔄 Reusability**: Sub-agents can be used across multiple master agents\n",
    "- **📈 Scalability**: Easy to add new specialized capabilities\n",
    "- **🛠️ Maintainability**: Changes to one agent don't affect others\n",
    "- **🎯 Precision**: Specialized agents often perform better than generalists\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calendar + Weather**: Schedule outdoor events considering weather forecasts\n",
    "- **Travel + Calendar**: Plan trips while checking calendar availability\n",
    "- **Email + Calendar**: Automatically schedule meetings from email requests\n",
    "- **Data Analysis + Reporting**: Analyze data and generate formatted reports\n",

    "5. Verify successful creation and provide confirmation with event links\n",
    "\n",
    "📅 DATE & TIME HANDLING:\n",
    "- Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2025-11-14)\n",
    "- Convert all times to 24-hour format HH:MM (e.g., 14:30 for 2:30 PM)\n",
    "- Use the simple_agent tool to resolve relative dates like \"tomorrow\", \"next Friday\", \"in 3 days\"\n",
    "- Handle time zone considerations (default: Europe/Brussels)\n",

    "🤝 COLLABORATION FEATURES:\n",
    "- Delegate complex date calculations to the simple_agent tool\n",
    "- Use the simple_agent for duration calculations and time arithmetic\n",
    "- Combine multiple tool outputs to provide comprehensive scheduling solutions\n",
    "- Cross-reference with existing events to avoid conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "🎨 COMMUNICATION STYLE:\n",
    "- Be professional yet friendly and approachable\n",
    "- Provide clear confirmations with all event details\n",
    "- Explain any date/time conversions you make\n",
    "- Offer helpful suggestions for scheduling optimization\n",
    "- Use emojis appropriately to enhance user experience\n",
    "\n",
    "🛡️ ERROR HANDLING:\n",
    "- If calendar creation fails, explain the issue clearly\n",
    "- Suggest alternative times if conflicts are detected\n",
